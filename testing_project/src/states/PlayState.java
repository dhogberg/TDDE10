/**
 * This state represents the Playing State of the Game
 * The main responsibility of this class is to;
 *	  - create Game Objects
 *	  - update Game Objects
 *	  - draw   Game Objects
 * Game Objects are for instance; players, enemies, npc's, etc...
 *
 * The PlayState can also be thought off
 * as a blue print where data is loaded into
 * som container from a file
 * or some other type of data storage.
 *
 * It can also be created
 * by some class responsible for
 * object creation and then passed to the
 * PlayState as a parameter. This means all the
 * PlayState has to do is recive a list of
 * objects, store them in som container
 * and then for every object in that container
 * update and render that object.
 *
 * This way you can let the user
 * define different Levels
 * based on what parameters
 * are passed into the PlayState.
